## Runtime Configuration

### Squid Whitelist

A default whitelist template is included with this image that permits access to AWS services.

The whitelist is generated by a whitelist template that is created on container startup based upon environment variables supplied to the container (see the Squid Configuration section below).

The following is the default whitelist that is generated if no configuration is provided to the container:

```
.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
iam.amazonaws.com
sts.amazonaws.com
support.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
waf.amazonaws.com
cloudfront.amazonaws.com
route53.amazonaws.com
route53domains.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
devicefarm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
importexport.amazonaws.com
```
